    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jack Burt and I'm currently studying BSc Computer Science at Surrey. I've always loved drawing and creating and decided I'd like to have somewhere to store and showcase my creations, so I made this website. <br><br>
    There's not a whole lot to showcase at the moment, but I'm hoping that will change in the near future. I like to explore a variety of skills and mediums, including trational media such as pen and ink, as well as digital drawing and design in Photoshop and Illustrator. I'm planning to venture into animation once I have the time as well. Another aspiration of mine is to create a small Indie video game title, which I have started but with my studies and other distractions getting in the way haven't made much progress with. <br><br>
    All of my digital works are done using my Surface Pro 4 and Adobe CC Programmes.
